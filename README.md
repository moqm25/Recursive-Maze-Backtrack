# Recursive-Maze-Backtrack
Backtrack through a self-defined maze and automatically find the path from the beginning to the end.


If you are attempting to walk through a maze, you will probably walk down a path as far as you can go. Eventually, you will reach your destination or you won’t be able to go any farther. If you can’t go any farther, you will need to consider alternative paths. Therefore we need to be able to systematically perform trial and error search. Backtracking is a way for doing just this so that you can perform a systematic non-repetitive search successfully using trial and error. Recursion allows you to implement backtracking in a relatively straightforward manner. Each activation frame is used to remember the choice that was made at that particular decision point. After returning from a recursive call you can perform other recursive calls to try out different paths.
This program implements a recursive program to find a path through a maze that employs the backtrack search.

To run this program open it as a project in a java compatible ide and run the MazeTest.java file.
